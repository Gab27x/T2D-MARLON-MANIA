# T2D-MARLON-MANIA
**Marlon Mania** is a new version of a game known as *Pipe Mania*, developed as the integrative task for the course "Computación y Estructuras Discretas I" at the University of Icesi, Colombia.The goal of the project was to implement different versions of a graph and usage of graph algorithms through the development of a game.
